title: Github Dashboard
shortDesc: Dashboard with basic searching capabilities using API's.
longDesc: This is my first time building a working dashboard and experimenting
  with APIs. By searching for a Github user in the right search panel, you can
  see repositories. The YT Search button allows you to look for a YouTube video.
  There is also an easy dark and light mode switch, as well as the ability to
  search for a location at the top to get the current time and weather for that
  location.
